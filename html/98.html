            <p class="startP" style="height: 13.6vh;">You choose to ask the creature why it helped you. It looks at you with a thoughtful expression.
                "I did not just help you out of kindness, young one. I helped because you are meant for more than what you know. The forest calls to those who are ready to listen, and you have proven that you can." With those words, you realize that you are no longer the same boy who entered these woods. You have grown, faced trials, and overcome your fears. The path home is open to you, but the knowledge of the magical realm remains inside you, a secret you can carry with you forever.</p>
