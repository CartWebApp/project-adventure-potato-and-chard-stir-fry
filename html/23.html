            <p class="startP" style="height: 13.6vh;">Charles pushed through the thicket, the branches scratching at his skin. The air was thick with the scent of moss and decay. He stumbled and fell into a clearing, where an enormous, green-eyed dragon lay coiled around a giant tree. The dragon’s wings twitched at his approach, but it didn’t seem hostile.<br>
            "I’ve been waiting," the dragon said softly, its voice filled with age and wisdom. "The witch sent you, didn’t she? I know what she’s done to you."<br>
            The dragon explained that he was a guardian of the forest, cursed by the witch long ago. If Charles could break the curse, the dragon would help him find his way home.</p>
