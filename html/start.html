            <p style="color: black; margin: 0%;">You are just a boy, no older than fifteen, your name is Charles Logan, living in a small village with no family at the edge of a vast and mysterious forest. One day, you venture into the woods to explore, as you often do, but something goes wrong. The trees seem to twist in unfamiliar ways, and the path you thought you knew disappears. Panic sets in as you realize you've lost your way. The sun is setting, and the shadows of the forest grow long and eerie.</p>
