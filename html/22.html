            <p class="startP" style="height: 13.6vh;">Charles entered the cave, the cold air biting at his skin. As he ventured deeper, the walls narrowed, and a low growl echoed through the darkness. Suddenly, he stumbled upon a massive creature, its glowing eyes fixed on him. It was a dragon, curled up on a bed of treasure, its scales shimmering like jewels.<br>
            The dragon’s deep voice rumbled, "You should not be here, little one. But, perhaps... you could help me."<br>
            Charles stood frozen, his mind racing. The dragon didn’t seem angry, just curious. "Help you? How?"<br>
            The dragon explained that it was cursed by the witch and had been trapped in the cave for centuries. Only a true friend could break the curse.</p>
