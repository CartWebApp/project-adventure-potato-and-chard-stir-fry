            <p class="chosen">You have picked: You get up and go to where you came from and sit there until you see someone cross the barrier. After about 30 minutes someone crosses and you take the chance to escape. As you follow the path back, a creature comes up to you. You can sense that it means no harm, and that it will lead you to your goal, but you don’t know how much you should trust it.</p>

            <p class="startP" style="height: 13.6vh;">The creature, sensing your uncertainty, leads you deeper into the forest to a clearing bathed in moonlight. It motions to a stone circle at the center, where a glowing orb rests. The creature explains that this orb is a gift—a way to find your path home, but only if you prove yourself worthy. It tells you of trials ahead and warns that you will face your fears.
            "You must pass the tests of the forest before you can leave," it says. "But I will guide you. Are you ready?"</p>
