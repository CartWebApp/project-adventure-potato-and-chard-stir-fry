            <p class="startP" style="height: 13.6vh;">The creature, sensing your uncertainty, leads you deeper into the forest to a clearing bathed in moonlight. It motions to a stone circle at the center, where a glowing orb rests. The creature explains that this orb is a gift—a way to find your path home, but only if you prove yourself worthy. It tells you of trials ahead and warns that you will face your fears.

                "You must pass the tests of the forest before you can leave," it says. "But I will guide you. Are you ready?"
