            <p class="startP" style="height: 13.6vh;">Charles decided to help the dragon. He gathered the courage to touch the dragon’s scales and, with a burst of magical energy, broke the curse. The dragon stretched its wings wide, the chains of its curse falling away. "Thank you, Charles," the dragon said, its voice filled with warmth.<br>
            As a reward, the dragon offered to fly Charles home. They soared over the forest, and Charles felt a deep sense of connection to the majestic creature. From that day forward, they became the best of friends, exploring the world together.</p>
