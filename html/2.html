            <p class="startP" style="height: 13.6vh;">As you wander deeper into the woods, you hear a strange sound—a soft rustling, followed by a low growl. A large shadow passes over you. Your heart races. A creature emerges from the underbrush, glowing faintly in the moonlight. It is not quite an animal, yet not quite human either. The creature looks at you, and for a moment, you feel a strange connection. It speaks in a voice that seems to echo in your mind.
            "You are lost, child. There is no way out, not without me. Will you follow me?"</p>
