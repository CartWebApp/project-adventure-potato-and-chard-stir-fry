            <p class="startP" style="height: 13.6vh;">Charles had thought he wanted to go home. But as he stood at the edge of the village, a different longing filled his heart. The village had not changed, but he had. The rhythm of human life, predictable and safe, now felt like a distant memory, a melody that no longer resonated with him.
                The rustling of leaves drew his attention. The creatures of the forest had gathered around him, waiting. They did not speak, yet he understood. This was not just a place of trials; it was a home unlike any other. A place of magic, of mystery, of endless adventure.<br>
                With a deep breath, Charles turned away from the village. He stepped back into the embrace of the forest, feeling its acceptance settle over him like a second skin. He was no longer a boy lost in the wild. He was part of it now. The silver stag bowed its head, the willow nymph smiled, and the shadow foxes let out playful yips. Charles smiled back. He had found where he truly belonged.</p>
