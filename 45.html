            Consequence: You return home safely, the dragon’s presence fading as the realms separate. You look back at the forest and realize how much you’ve learned—about magic, about yourself, and about the bond you shared with the dragon.</p>

            <p class="startP" style="height: 13.6vh;">You return home, but the memories of the dragon and the realm linger in your heart. You are forever changed by the journey you took and the bond you formed with a creature of legend.  Though you have returned to your world, the adventures you had in the realm are a part of you now. You’ll always carry the lessons learned from the dragon, knowing that when the time is right, the veil between worlds may open again.</p>
